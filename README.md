# Pi - Mono Library for GPIO and I2C
This repository contains a C++ project for running GPIO and I2C on the Raspberry Pi, a C# wrapper for the C++ project, and a test project to validate that it all works.
This material is in the early stages of development, but it has been tested with the Raspberry Pi B+ and Raspberry Pi 2 models, using GPIO and I2c on the TCS34725 colour sensor module and PCA9685 PWM module.
This project requires that the i2c-dev kernel module be enabled on the Pi for I2C functionality.
Any questions or comments are always welcome.
